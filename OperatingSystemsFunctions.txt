One operating system function is that they provide a user interface. A user interface controls how data and intstructions are entered and how information is displayed on the screen. Most users work with a graphical user interface, where you interact with visual images by touching, pointing, tapping, and clicking objects to issue commands.
Another operating system function is managing memory. RAM consists of one or more chips on the motherboard that hold items like data and instructions while the processor interprets and executes them. The operating system assigns data and instructions to an area of memory while they are being processed, monitors the contents of memory, and releases these items when the processor no longer requires them.
